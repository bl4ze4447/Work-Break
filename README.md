Do you want to take breaks when working on a Word, Excel, Access or PowerPoint project and go outside or make your bed?

Look no further, this app will basically block every input to your PC after the time set in settings.ini (or default, 50min work and 15min break)!!!
Also, it will play a cool song of your choosing, just make sure it is in the same folder as the executable and that it is named "BreakSound.wav"! exactly like that or it will default to the windows default error sound on a loop and you will go crazy
it must be a wav :O!!!
After the break time is over the computer unblocks and you can go back to your boring stuff.

The app needs to be in administrator mode otherwise it just wont block your input and it will tell you that it cant block because????

FEATURES:
- Good error handling, that is why, the app checks for every case where something could go wrong and it tells the user.
- Good memory handling!! YUP, no pointers left in the air or handles not closed or anything!!!
- Good performance! It is written in C++23, what do you expect? also I am a good developer (I like to tell myself that)
- Great customization!! You can set your own song and times, what more do you want???
- Not annoying!! YES!! because you cannot see the windows unless an error has come up or its time for the break
- Only one app possible at runtime! (unless you prick dont run it two times with different names at the same time, then the double blocking is on you)

WHY???
my gf wanted the app so I made it

Jokes aside, I tried my best to code the app while keeping performance at a maximum and readability too. I tried to keep it simple and concise so anyone can read it and I tried to follow the recommended C++23 standard of programming.
Hope you like it.
